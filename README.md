# Deepfake-detection

### Our Project aims in finding the AI-generated fingerprints from the ones which are legit and original

## Resize.py
This python file is used to resize the original images to a pixel dimension of 224*224 as our project demands.You can also change the resolution according to your needs in the code

## original_dataset.zip
Has the dataset collected from various sources

## resized(224*224).zip
The images which we got after resizing

## normalised.zip
The images which are normalised

## Generated_Dataset.zip
Has the dataset on AI-generated images

## Generated_Resized_Normalised
Has the Generated images which are resized and then normalised.

## normalise.py
Min-Max Normalization: This involves scaling the pixel values to a fixed range, like [0, 1]. Each pixel value is transformed by subtracting the minimum pixel value of the image and then dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum pixel values

## üìÅ Dataset Download

The original and resized fingerprint datasets are too large for GitHub.  
Please download them from this shared Google Drive folder:

üîó [Download Datasets (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19QanCCAnysk-3JebsYqcXtaaZCz-RJcj?usp=drive_link)

**Contents:**
- `original_dataset.zip`
- `resized(224x224).zip`
- `normalised.zip`
- `Generated_Dataset.zip`
- `Generated_Resized_Normalised`

After downloading, extract the ZIP files and place them in the project directory or a new `datasets/` folder.
